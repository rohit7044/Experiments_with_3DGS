# Experiments with Gaussian Splatting

This is an experimental repo of using various approaches to solve key challenges in Gaussian Splatting.</n>
As per my knowledge the difficult challenges are:
1. Proper mesh from splats.
2. Cleaning unnecessary splats.
3. Gaussian Splats with Sparse Data(ill-posed)

Completed:
1. Experimented on Gaussian Splatting using Splatfacto from [Nerfstudio](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio)

Current Task:
1. Is it possible to edit Splats like [SIGNeRF](https://docs.nerf.studio/nerfology/methods/signerf.html)?
2. How to get cleaner mesh from splats?
